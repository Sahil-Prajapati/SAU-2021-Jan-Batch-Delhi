    	<h2>Infosys, Wipro see sharp pick up in growth in Q3</h2>
    	<img src="pictures/news1pic.png" class = "uppernews" alt="News" type="image/icon type">
    
	    <p>Clients’ demands for a digital overhaul of their businesses – to mitigate disruptions of the kind they suffered during the pandemic – is leading to a surge in orders for Indian IT services companies. It’s also enabling the latter to quickly lift themselves from the early pandemic lows.</p>



		<p>In a seasonally weak quarter, which is marked by the holiday season and furloughs, Infosys grew by 5.3% sequentially, while Wipro grew by 3.4%, which nearly met the top end of its revenue guidance for the quarter. Year-on-year growth rates are significantly better than in the first two quarters, and look to be fast heading towards pre-Covid levels.</p>

	      <blockquote>
	        “We are ready to participate in all these (large deals) and have our capabilities ready. The large deal wins give us confidence for the quarter ahead,” Infosys CEO Salil Parekh, who completed three years at the helm, said.

		    <h2>Where coronavirus vaccines will be produced</h2>
		    <img src="pictures/news2pic.png" class = "uppernews" alt="News" type="image/icon type">
		    
		    <p>According to data analytics company Airfinity, the US has the capability to produce almost 4.7 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses up until the end of 2021. India also has a high capability to produce the vaccine at more than 3 billion possible doses, according to the findings published by Deutsche Welle.</p>
		    
		    <p>India is home to the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world, the Serum Institute of India. The company produces almost 1.4 billion doses annually, as per 2015 figures which are the latest available. In comparison, the same report by the Access to Medicine Foundation showed that Sanofi produced 1 billion vaccine doses that same year while GlaxoSmithKline made almost 700 million.</p>

		    <p>Pfizer kept their numbers confidential. Despite the high number of doses, the Serum Institute earned far less with their vaccines due to the fact that most of them are sold at a low price domestically. In 2015, the company had revenues of just approximately $566 million, while Sanofi and Pfizer made between 35 and almost 50 billion, respectively.</p>

A second, domestically made vaccine, Covaxin, has also been approved already in the country despite stage III trials still underway and efficacy number not having been published.
